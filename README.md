# Social Hub - Advanced Social Networking Platform

**Social Hub** is a next-generation social networking platform designed to enhance user experience, content moderation, and security. Built on the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), it incorporates state-of-the-art features like NLP-powered content moderation, context-based authentication, and real-time user engagement.

## Features

- **Advanced Content Moderation**: Utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to automatically filter harmful content such as spam, toxic comments, and profanity. Integrated with the **Perspective API**, **Text-Razor**, and **Hugging Face APIs** for accurate content classification.
- **Context-Aware Authentication**: Enhances account security by analyzing user location, IP, and device information during login attempts. Unusual activity triggers email alerts to users for verification.
- **Three User Roles**:  
  - **Admins**: Manage system settings and content.
  - **Moderators**: Review flagged content for moderation.
  - **General Users**: Post, comment, like, share, and report inappropriate content.
- **User Interaction**: Engage with the platform through likes, comments, following/unfollowing, and account management.
- **Scalability**: Optimized for performance, ensuring a smooth experience as the user base grows, with enhanced back-end features, better database handling, and caching.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Content Moderation**: NLP APIs (Perspective, Text-Razor, Hugging Face)
- **Authentication**: Context-aware security using IP, location, and device data
- **Deployment**: Docker (for easy deployment in production)

## Objectives

- Maximize **content moderation** accuracy with state-of-the-art NLP solutions.
- Implement **context-based authentication** to enhance user security.
- Foster **user engagement** and create a vibrant community.
- Ensure the platform is **scalable** and performs optimally as user growth increases.
